This Mod brings you the Sakura Empire (Juuyo) from Azur Lane, and its four leaders: Ayanami, Yuudachi, Shigure, and Yukikaze. All characters are fully voiced ☆

The unique infrastructure of Sakura Empire is the Cerise Imperial Dockyard (replaces Shipyard), and the Sakura Jinja (replaces Holy Site). These provide naval combat bonuses as well as faith buffs to the civilization.
Under Gathering Storm mode, the civilization has a unique Governor "Akashi", who will also provide 2 unique builder units "Universal Bulin" and "Prototype Bulin MKII". [strike](the strongest unit in the game!!) [/strike]

As with all my other civs, this Mod has unique city names, place names, and background music. There is 30 min of BGM from the original Azur Lane game, which can play alongside my other mod civs and vanilla civilizations in the game.

[h1]Mod Highlights[/h1][list]
[*][b]Compatible with All Game Rules[/b]
You can play it without any DLC. Though you would need Gathering Storm for unique Governor and Bulins.

[*][b]All Characters Fully Voiced[/b]
All Leaders have their unique voice lines in diplomacy screen. Even Governor Akashi has her own voiced speeches! There're 70+ unique speeches in total.

[*][b]Names that Never Run Out[/b]
There are 50 city names and 50 character (ship) names, as well as plenty of place names from historical and game backgrounds. So you can comfortably have multiple Sakura Empire Leaders in the same game and names won't run out.[/list]

[h1]Known Issues[/h1][list]
[*][b]Leader Voices Sometimes Played Twice?[/b]
This is a problem of the base game. Leaders from in-game civs also experience the same issue.

[*][b]Music Stopped until Next Era Begins?[/b]
This problem is caused by other Mods. Please use this Mod together with original civilizations in the game, as well as Mod civilizations that have configured music properly (like my other Mods and [url=steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198181931490]姥鲨[/url], [url=steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198402598762]Dwughjsd[/url]'s Mods). If a Mod civ on the map didn't implement music in the correct way, the BGM will get stuck after encountered that mod civ on the map.

[*][b]No Governor Akashi nor Bulins in Game?[/b]
These are contents enabled by DLC Gathering Storm. Besides, you can't train Bulins. They are only given as gifts from Governor Akashi.[/list]
